Project Title:
Survey App â€“ Customizable Online Surveys

Description:
The Survey App is a web-based application developed using the Spring Framework to facilitate the creation, distribution, and analysis of surveys. The app allows users to create customizable surveys with various question types, such as multiple-choice, rating scales, and open-ended responses. It is designed with both administrators and participants in mind, providing seamless functionality and user-friendly navigation.

Key Features:

Survey Creation: Administrators can create surveys with diverse question formats, set deadlines, and manage visibility settings.
User Management: Role-based access control allows differentiation between administrators (survey creators) and participants (respondents).
Participation: Participants can access surveys via unique links and submit responses anonymously or with user identification.
Data Analytics: Survey results are presented in an interactive dashboard with visual analytics such as pie charts, bar graphs, and downloadable reports.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA for database management, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
Frontend: React/Angular for dynamic user interfaces (optional addition).
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for storing survey data.
API Integration: RESTful APIs for seamless communication between the backend and frontend.
Deployment: Hosted on a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku for scalability and reliability.
Learning Outcomes:

Gained hands-on experience in using Spring Boot for backend development.
Implemented secure authentication and authorization mechanisms with Spring Security.
Designed and consumed REST APIs for frontend-backend communication.
Explored database design and integration with JPA/Hibernate.
Enhanced skills in deploying applications to a cloud environment.
